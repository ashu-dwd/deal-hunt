# 🚀 DealDrop: Because Who Doesn't Love Hunting for Bargains? 💸

_(When your code works but the deals don't)_

Welcome to **DealDrop**, the app that turns your shopping addiction into a "smart investment strategy"! 🛒✨ Tired of paying full price? Join the elite club of deal hunters who spend more time stalking prices than actually buying stuff. Because nothing says "responsible adult" like refreshing a page every 5 minutes waiting for that 10% off. 🙄

## 🎯 Features That Will Blow Your Mind (Or Just Your Wallet)

- **🔍 Smart Price Tracking**: Watch prices drop faster than your motivation on Monday mornings. Our cron jobs work tirelessly (unlike you) to check for deals every hour. ⏰
- **📱 Beautiful UI**: Built with Next.js and shadcn/ui because who needs ugly apps? Looks so good, you'll forget it's just for saving money. 😍
- **🔐 Authentication**: Sign up with Supabase because we trust you... mostly. Don't hack us, k? 🛡️
- **📧 Email Notifications**: Get spammed with deal alerts! Because your inbox wasn't full enough already. 📬
- **🕷️ Web Scraping Magic**: Firecrawl does the dirty work so you don't have to. Ethical scraping? What's that? 🤖
- **📊 Product Management**: Add products, track them, lose them – it's like digital hoarding but with discounts! 🏷️

## 🛠️ Installation: Because Setting Up Is Half the Fun (Said No One Ever)

1. Clone this repo faster than you can say "impulse buy":

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashu-dwd/deal-hunt.git
   cd deal-hunt
   ```

2. Install dependencies – hope you have pnpm because npm is for peasants:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Set up your env vars in `.env` – don't forget or it'll crash spectacularly:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_scraping_key
   EMAIL_API_KEY=spam_enabler
   ```

4. Run the dev server and pretend you're a developer:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and start hunting deals! 🏹

_(You vs. the full-price item you're stalking)_

## 🚀 Usage: How to Waste Time Productively

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Because anonymous deal hunting is for amateurs. 🔑
2. **Add Products**: Paste that Amazon link and watch the magic happen. ✨
3. **Wait for Deals**: Our cron job checks prices. Go make coffee. ☕
4. **Get Notified**: Emails will flood your inbox. Don't say we didn't warn you. 📧
5. **Buy Stuff**: Finally use that saved money on more stuff you don't need. 🛍️

Pro tip: Set up alerts for things you actually need, not just "that one gadget you've been eyeing for 6 months". 💡
